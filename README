RNID SIP STACK
==============

This library of code consists of three main parts:
* a SIP stack (RFC 3261),
* an RTP stack (RFC 3550), and
* SDP (RFC 2327) parsing and utilities.

The code currently implements most of SIP, RTP. The stack can make and receive
calls from/to X-Lite, linphonec. It also connects correctly with ser, the Sip
Express Router.

Of the stuff not implemented, the most important missing bits include:
 * no SRV/NAPTR DNS resolution;
 * no RFC 3263 discovery mechanisms;
 * RTP loop detection

Known bugs:
 * Sometimes certain threads don't die cleanly. This makes the application 
   quietly hang in the background when you kill the spike prototype.
