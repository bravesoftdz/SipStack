RNID SIP STACK
==============

This library of code consists of three main parts:
* a SIP stack (RFC 3261),
* an RTP stack (RFC 3550), and
* SDP (RFC 2327) parsing and utilities.

The code currently implements most of SIP, RTP. The stack can make and
receive calls from/to X-Lite, linphonec. It also connects correctly
with ser, the Sip Express Router.

The stack uses Indy 9.0.14 (but 9.0.18 should work fine). Find this
excellent library either in your Delphi\Sources\Indy directory or at
http://www.indyproject.org/

Note that Indy doesn't support some functionality that a SIP stack
requires, such as SRV and NAPTR DNS records. In the indy-patches
directory you'll find all patches to the Indy project. You'll have to
merge these changes into your Indy setup.

All test code relies on the DUnit test framework. See
http://dunit.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Of the stuff not implemented, the most important missing bits include:
 * S/MIME;
 * proxy classes

The main interface to the stack - the interface you want to use to USE
the stack, as opposed to extend the stack - is in
src\IdSipStackInterface.

If you're interested in hacking the stack, take a look at the
SingleCoreSpike class in tests\SingleCoreSpike.pas. It illustrates, in
a basic way, how to use the SIP stack.

Please note that this version, 0.5, has a radically different
threading architecture to version 0.3 Please read the CHANGES file,
doc\overview.txt and doc\architecture.txt!

Todo:
* We need to implement client-side authentication for certain classes
  of message. In particular, we need to make sure that NOTIFYs,
  INVITEs with a Replaces header, and probably SUBSCRIBE messages need
  authentication.

Known bugs:
* TLS tests fail because of something to do with the certificates.
* There are still some subtle race conditions in the transport. When
  they occur, they're quite uncomfortable because the
  TId(TCP|UDP)Servers then don't deactivate, and the program appears
  to hang after you close it.
* The TCP transport test TestSendResponsesClosedConnection has a race
  condition somewhere.
