RNID SIP STACK
==============

This library of code consists of three main parts:
* a SIP stack (RFC 3261),
* an RTP stack (RFC 3550), and
* SDP (RFC 2327) parsing and utilities.

The code currently implements most of SIP, RTP. The stack can make and receive
calls from/to X-Lite, linphonec. It also connects correctly with ser, the Sip
Express Router.

The stack uses Indy 9.0.14 (but 9.0.18 should work fine). Find this
excellent library either in your Delphi\Sources\Indy directory or at
http://www.indyproject.org/

All test code relies on the DUnit test framework. See
http://dunit.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Of the stuff not implemented, the most important missing bits include:
 * no SRV/NAPTR DNS resolution;
 * no RFC 3263 discovery mechanisms;
 * S/MIME

Take a look at the Spike class in tests\Spike.pas. It does a lot of stuff, but
it should show you what you need to do to get your very own SIP stack up and
running. I plan to simplify Spike to ease the reader into the ways of
SIP. Please note that the code in Spike is somewhere around prototype
quality - the UI elements will sometimes behave oddly.

Todo:
* The User Agent knows about what kinds of actions it supports. We
  need to pull this knowledge out into separate OutboundModules, much
  like the existing inbound MessageModules.

Known bugs:
* TCP clients don't send/receive data in a separate thread. This
  makes the main/VCL thread hang while you send messages.
* Very occasionally the TCP transport tests fail with an access
  violation inside TIdTCPConnection.ReadFromStack, in the 0041nnnn
  address range. I currently develop the stack on Indy 9.0.14. I don't
  know if this is a bug in Indy's code or if I'm doing something
  subtly wrong in my code.
* TLS tests fail because of something to do with the certificates.
