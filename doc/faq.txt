1. The project won't compile!

2. The project's broken! It raises exceptions all over the place!

3. Where do I begin?

4. How do I create a new header type?

5. When my test runs and I expect a message to be sent. It's not. Why?

6. The tests take too long to run. I only want to test this little
   test unit. What do I do?








1. Check that you've installed DUnit (http://dunit.sourceforge.net/),
   and, if you're running Indy 9, that you've installed the patch in
   the indy-patches directory to Indy 9.

2. If you're running the test suite or demo in the IDE, then you'll
   find exceptions (like EParserError, EBadHeader) being raised. This
   is normal. If you look further in the call stack you'll see those
   exceptions being caught. If they bug you, just turn off the "Stop
   on Delphi Exceptions" when running the tests.

3. Read the class comment on TIdSipStackConfigurator. Decide on what
   configuration you want, put that configuration in a TStrings, and
   invoke TIdSipStackConfigurator.CreateUserAgent.

4. TIdSipHeader is the base class for all header types. Follow these
   steps to define a new header type:
   * find a suitable subclass (e.g., if the header primarily consists
     of an address, subclass TIdSipAddressHeader);
   * override GetName;
   * override GetValue, if necessary;
   * override Parse, if necessary;
   * add the header type to TIdSipHeaderList.HeaderTypes;
   * add the header name (possibly both full and short forms) to
     TIdSipHeaderList.CanonicaliseName.

5. Your first bet would be to make sure that the Locator can resolve
   the hostname in the requests's Request-URI or response's top-most
   Via header. See if the stack signals OnNetworkFailure. If it does,
   add a new A or AAAA record to the locator by means of AddA/AddAAAA
   as part of the test setup.

6. Comment out the unwanted test units. Unfortunately, up to at least
   version 0.5.2, TestIdSipStackInterface depends on the StackWindow
   unit. If you comment out TestIdSipStackInterface be sure to comment
   out StackWindow. Conversely, if you want to test
   TestIdSipStackInterface, be sure to uncomment the StackWindow line
   in SIP.dpr's uses clause.
