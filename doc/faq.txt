1. Where do I begin?

2. How do I create a new header type?

3. When my test runs and I expect a message to be sent. It's not. Why?














1. Read the class comment on TIdSipStackConfigurator. Decide on what
   configuration you want, put that configuration in a TStrings, and
   invoke TIdSipStackConfigurator.CreateUserAgent.

2. TIdSipHeader is the base class for all header types. Follow these
   steps to define a new header type:
   * find a suitable subclass (e.g., if the header primarily consists
     of an address, subclass TIdSipAddressHeader);
   * override GetName;
   * override GetValue, if necessary;
   * override Parse, if necessary;
   * add the header type to TIdSipHeaderList.HeaderTypes;
   * add the header name (possibly both full and short forms) to
     TIdSipHeaderList.CanonicaliseName.

3. Your first bet would be to make sure that the Locator can resolve
   the hostname in the requests's Request-URI or response's top-most
   Via header. See if the stack signals OnNetworkFailure. If it does,
   add a new A or AAAA record to the locator by means of AddA/AddAAAA
   as part of the test setup.
