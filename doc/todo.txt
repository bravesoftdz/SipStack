3.1.4.4. Confirmation of Subscription Creation

   The subscriber can expect to receive a NOTIFY message from each node
   which has processed a successful subscription or subscription
   refresh.  Until the first NOTIFY message arrives, the subscriber
   should consider the state of the subscribed resource to be in a
   neutral state.  Documents which define new event packages MUST define
   this "neutral state" in such a way that makes sense for their
   application (see section 4.4.7.).

3.1.6.1. Initial SUBSCRIBE Transaction Processing

   The notifier SHOULD also perform any necessary authentication and
   authorization per its local policy.  See section 3.1.6.3.

3.1.6.3. Authentication/Authorization of SUBSCRIBE requests

3.2.1. Identification of Reported Events, Event Classes, and Current
       State

   Event packages may define semantics associated with the body of their
   NOTIFY requests; if they do so, those semantics apply.  NOTIFY bodies
   are expected to provide additional details about the nature of the
   event which has occurred and the resultant resource state.

   When present, the body of the NOTIFY request MUST be formatted into
   one of the body formats specified in the "Accept" header of the
   corresponding SUBSCRIBE request.  This body will contain either the
   state of the subscribed resource or a pointer to such state in the
   form of a URI (see section 4.4.13).

3.3.4. Dialog creation and termination
   Multiple subscriptions can be associated with a single dialog.
   Subscriptions may also exist in dialogs associated with INVITE-
   created application state and other application state created by
   mechanisms defined in other specifications.  These sets of
   application state do not interact beyond the behavior described for a
   dialog (e.g., route set handling).

2.4.2 Processing a REFER request

   A UA accepting a well-formed REFER request SHOULD request approval
   from the user to proceed (this request could be satisfied with an
   interactive query or through accessing configured policy).  If
   approval is granted, the UA MUST contact the resource identified by
   the URI in the Refer-To header field value as discussed in Section
   2.4.3.

   If the approval sought above for a well-formed REFER request is
   immediately denied, the UA MAY decline the request.

[We already notify the UI of inbound subscriptions:
OnSubscriptionRequest. The UI in turn accesses the referred resource
in an appropriate manner.]

2.4.7 Using the Subscription-State Header Field with Event Refer

   In the case where a REFER was accepted with a 202, but approval to
   follow the reference was subsequently denied, the reason and retry-
   after elements of the Subscription-State header field can be used to
   indicate if and when the REFER can be re-attempted (as described for
   SUBSCRIBE in [2]).

Notes:
SUBSCRIBE & REFER both act a bit like sessions: different messages, of
different methods, relate to the same thing.
